By Fire Be Purged is a JSON api that enables users to schedule and plan World of
Warcraft raids. It uses the [World of Warcraft API](https://dev.battle.net/) in
order to collect character information and uses
[Battle.net OAuth](https://dev.battle.net/docs/read/oauth) for authentication.

The reference implementation and default front end of the API is
[Core the Loot Hound](http://coretheloothound.com/) which is an
[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) application. Feel free to use it for your guild
raids and let us know what you think!
